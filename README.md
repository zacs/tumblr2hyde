tumblr2hyde
===========

*Not currently working yet*. Script for pulling posts out of Tumblr and creating content for Hyde. 

Usage
-----

1. Go to Tumblr and [request an API key](http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/register). 
2. Paste the *OAuth Consumer Key* into the script as `API_KEY`.
3. Enter your site's root Tumblr URL as `TUMBLR_ROOT`.
4. In the terminal: `python tumblr2hyde.py`

That should do it. No need really to set up a virtualenv, as there are no requirement modules outside of core Python libraries.
