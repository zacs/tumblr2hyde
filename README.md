tumblr2hyde
===========

Script for pulling posts out of Tumblr and creating content for Jekyll or Hyde. 

Usage
-----

1. Go to Tumblr and [request an API key](http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/register). 
2. Paste the *OAuth Consumer Key* into the script as `API_KEY`.
3. Enter your site's root Tumblr URL as `TUMBLR_ROOT`.
4. [Optional] Change the `TEXT_ONLY` setting to False if you want more than just your text posts.
5. [Optional] Add/remove tuples from the `CUSTOM_FIELDS` dictionary. [More info](#custom_fields).
6. In the terminal: `python tumblr2hyde.py` -- the directory structure for Hyde will be created wherever the script is run from.

Assumptions
-----------

1. The Tumblr V2 API stil exists.
2. You are using a traditional Jekyll (or Hyde) structure (eg. /blog/contents/ and /media/images/). If not, the script is easy enough to edit on your own.
3. You don't really care about the `description` field in the posts, since Tumblr doesn't have one (I just re-write the title there).

### <a id="custom_fields"/>Details on custom fields

Many Hyde templates require some extra fields in order to render correctly. [Michael Grosner](http://www.michaelgrosner.com/blog/2011/8/5-installing-hyde.html) covers some of this in his excellent Hyde tutorial (see the _Including Content_ section of the link above for more details). I have that setting pre-populated with the values from Michael's post. They won't hurt anything if you don't need them, but feel free to delete as well.

That should do it. No need really to set up a virtualenv, as there are no requirement modules outside of core Python libraries.
